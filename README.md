### No More Lost Logs

BackUpLogs v2 is designed for the game [PavlovVR](https://www.vankrupt.com/) and is used by community servers.

- The game purges logs after a few days, making it important to back them up.

### SETTINGS

To tailor the script to your needs, modify the variables in the `Settings.sh` file. It's important to set these before running the script for the first time:

- **backUpDir**="/home/steam/logs"  
  Where you want the saved files to be placed (use full path, no `~`).

- **whereIsThisScript**=""  
  The installation location of this script.

- **webHook**="true"  
  Enable or disable the webhook (true or false).

- **icon**='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932110907729920080/1130204308315578459/6328646.png'  
  Ideally, use a Discord URL.
